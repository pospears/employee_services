Maven build run option
./mvnw spring-boot:run on root folder against pom.xml

Design Choices:
All dependencies required to run the application are contained within the pom.xml and are loaded via maven
The application is running on top of SpringBoot 2.4.4;  
	SpringBoot provides an embedded Tomcat Server; so need to install elsewhere.   VueJS and Vuetrify are used on the frontend.

  General:  Upon startup of the application a generator will randomly create 1000 employees, for paginated display at /. You may add addition employees with the provided UI components; remove of employees are not allowed.
  Frontend: There is only one jsp file for all view logic; the file has uses vuetify for provisioning a the ui components; the UI components consists of a date range filter field that accepts a range selection of dates, an search field, and a new button to add new employees;  field validation provided where needed included.  
  Backend:  RestController accepts request via RESTful endpoints; leveraging a service class that proxies to a persistence layer before returning a list of available employees to the frontend. 
  			The /search endpoint does not take any parameters and returns the employee list for pagination, The /addEmployees endpoint accepts employee information to add an new employee if they are not already in the database
  Database:
     The application makes use of an embedded in-memory H2 database instead of a standalone db install
     The application uses JPA to define the schema along with any required tables (as annotations), and queries; because of this there is no need for a table create script. 
     See Employee class for db annotations.   
 
Check Health Endpoint
localhost:8080/actuator/health

Basic JUnit Tests are included to verify the RESTful endpoint functionality
